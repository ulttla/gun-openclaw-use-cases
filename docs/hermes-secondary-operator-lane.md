# Hermes Complementary Operator Lane

## 60-second summary

Hermes is used as a complementary operator lane for the AI Engineering Lab: a separate assistant environment that can review recovery plans, inspect public-safe evidence, run focused research, and help reason through OpenClaw outages or risky updates.

The important design choice is restraint. Hermes is not presented as unattended failover or a second autonomous production administrator. It is an active complementary lane for research, audit, and recovery support that remains behind human approval gates for service restarts, config edits, credentials, package updates, and external publishing.

## Why add a second lane

A single AI operator can become a coordination bottleneck if the runtime is degraded, the session is reset, or an update changes behavior. A complementary lane helps with:

- independent review of update and rollback plans;
- recovery checklist access when the primary lane is unavailable;
- public-safe digestion of private wiki notes into reusable patterns;
- focused research and follow-up automation from a separate operating context;
- separation between builder/orchestrator output and operational audit;
- continuity for long-running work after restart or context loss.

## Operating boundaries

| Boundary | Public-safe rule |
|---|---|
| Access | The lane may inspect approved docs, redacted notes, and recovery checklists. |
| Changes | Runtime changes remain approval-gated and evidence-backed. |
| Updates | Version-changing actions require backup, rollback, and smoke-test evidence. |
| Channels | Avoid two assistants answering or mutating the same workflow at once. |
| Publishing | Public GitHub, portfolio, or social posting still needs explicit approval. |

## Example recovery workflow

1. Primary operator reports degraded behavior or a risky update proposal.
2. Hermes reviews the recovery checklist, rollback anchors, and smoke matrix.
3. The human operator approves or rejects the proposed action.
4. The active operator performs the change through the approved path.
5. Hermes or another review lane checks the evidence and caveats.
6. A sanitized closeout is written for future reuse.

## What this demonstrates

- assistant operations as a reliability problem, not only a prompting problem;
- separation of duties between orchestration and audit;
- update safety and restart recovery discipline;
- public-safe knowledge transfer from private wiki notes to reusable documentation;
- honest limits around AI autonomy.

## Recommended public wording

Use:

> Added a secondary operator lane for audit and recovery support, with human-approved update/restart gates and public-safe evidence capture.

Or:

> Used OpenClaw and Hermes as complementary operator lanes: broad coordination in OpenClaw, focused research and recovery review in Hermes, with shared context and approval gates.

Avoid:

> Built a fully autonomous backup agent that can repair everything by itself.
